Dear Marker,

- The board is made of panels so there is not functionality in clicking on it,
however the buttons by the dices let you choose your columns. 

- We have load/save and AI implemented. 

- For color deficiency settings, we decided to avoid making different settings
as not to stigmatize the players, and we instead did our best to make the 
game accessible. We have made the board red with a blue background, since red
and blue are combinations that the majority of colour blind individuals can
tell apart, as well as a white border on the edge just in case the red and 
blue are not clear (we researched this!). 

- We also allowed for shapes and colors seperately so that the pieces could 
still be identifiable regardless of color.

- Panels are sized for full screen, so please resize the window to full screen
when you get to the board.

- When a players name has a white background, that means it is their turn. Turn
order is displayed at the start of the game.

Thank you,
From Group 8 :)
