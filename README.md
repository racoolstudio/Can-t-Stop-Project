# Can't Stop Board Project - Academic Group Project


Welcome to the Can't Stop Board Game project repository! This project was developed as part of an academic group project by Ridwan Abdulwaheed, Emily Dormody, Yuvraj Kalsi, Nathan Quinton, and Rushi Chaudhary. The project aimed to create a digital version of the classic Can't Stop board game, focusing on game aspects such as graphics, scripts, and a user interface.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JSwing (Java's library for GUI)
- JUnit (for unit testing)
- Agile Software Development Cycle
- GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

## Project Description
The Can't Stop Board Game project aimed to recreate the excitement and challenge of the popular board game in a digital format. Our academic group worked collaboratively to design and implement the game's graphical elements, user interface, and gameplay mechanics using Java and JSwing. The project followed the principles of the Agile Software Development Cycle, ensuring efficient development and continuous improvement.

## Usage Instructions
To play the Can't Stop Board Game, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Compile and run the game application.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Unit Testing
We implemented unit testing using JUnit to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application. Test cases were developed and applied throughout the development process to identify and fix any issues or bugs.

## Repository Status
This repository was created for our academic group project and the cooperative internship program. It is currently publicly available to showcase our work and skills during this period. However, as part of our commitment to safeguarding sensitive information and intellectual property, the repository will be made private after the cooperative internship program concludes. 

We are proud to have collaborated on this project and appreciate your understanding of our decision to restrict access to the repository for privacy and security reasons.

## Contribution
As this is an academic project repository, contributions from outside the group may not be accepted. The project serves as a demonstration of our academic achievements and collaboration during the course.
